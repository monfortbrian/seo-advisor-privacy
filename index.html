      SEO Advisor - Chrome Extension<br />Last updated: 2026-02-17
    </div>

    <p>
      SEO Advisor (“the extension”) is designed to help ecommerce store owners
      and marketers identify and fix on-page SEO issues. This Privacy Policy
      explains what data is processed, how it is used, and how it is protected.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SEO Advisor analyzes ecommerce product pages only when a user explicitly
      initiates a scan. The extension reads visible on-page SEO elements (such
      as metadata, headings, images, and structured data) to generate guidance.
      No background monitoring or passive browsing tracking occurs.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information Processed</h2>
    <h3>a) Page Content (Local Analysis)</h3>
    <p>
      When a scan is triggered, the extension temporarily reads the active
      webpage’s SEO-relevant content to perform analysis. This includes elements
      such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meta tags and page titles</li>
      <li>Headings and text structure</li>
      <li>Images and alt attributes</li>
      <li>Structured data (schema markup)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This content is processed only for SEO analysis and guidance generation.
    </p>

    <h3>b) Account Information</h3>
    <p>
      If the user signs in, authentication is handled via Google OAuth and
      Supabase. Basic account data such as email address and subscription status
      may be stored securely to manage usage limits and plan features.
    </p>

    <h3>c) Local Storage</h3>
    <p>The extension stores limited data locally in the browser, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scan usage counts and plan limits</li>
      <li>Recent analysis results</li>
      <li>User interface preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data improves performance and user experience and can be removed by
      uninstalling the extension.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How Data Is Used</h2>
    <p>Data is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Analyze product pages for SEO issues</li>
      <li>Provide step-by-step SEO guidance</li>
      <li>Manage subscription features and scan limits</li>
      <li>Display analysis results in the extension interface</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Sale</h2>
    <p>
      SEO Advisor does not sell, rent, or trade user data. Data is not shared
      with third parties except for essential infrastructure providers required
      to operate the service (e.g., authentication and database services).
    </p>

    <h2>5. No Tracking or Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      The extension does not use trackers, advertising identifiers, or
      cross-site monitoring. Browsing activity outside user-initiated scans is
      not collected or observed.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Local analysis data remains in the user’s browser until cleared or the
      extension is removed. Account data is retained only as long as the user
      maintains an active account or subscription.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      Account and subscription data are stored using Supabase secure
      infrastructure. Authentication is handled through Google OAuth. Reasonable
      technical safeguards are applied to protect stored data.
    </p>

    <h2>8. User Control</h2>
    <p>Users can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the extension without signing in (limited features)</li>
      <li>Clear local data by uninstalling the extension</li>
      <li>Request account deletion by contacting support</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      SEO Advisor is intended for business and professional use and is not
      directed to children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect product or regulatory
      changes. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised date.
